I (mostly) lurk in #sourcefu, #crimsonfu and other freenode IRC channels trying to offer useful help & advice where I can.
My professional world is Infra/Ops Engineering (SRE) mostly in the area of providing services to Software Developers such as CI/CD, Config Managment and all the myriad components that are a distraction from their core purpose.

I (used to?) occasionally write a http://www.allgoodbits.org and have helped organize tech conferences (mostly USENIX LISA).
