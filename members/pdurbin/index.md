I started the #sourcefu IRC channel (where I go by "pdurbin") and log it at <http://irclog.greptilian.com/sourcefu/today>

<http://greptilian.com> is my website, where you can find links to my various accounts online. My projects can be found at <https://github.com/pdurbin>

I authored most of the sourcefu home page, including our guiding principles, and created the [sourcefu logo](/logo).

You can read more about me at <http://wiki.greptilian.com/about/pdurbin>
