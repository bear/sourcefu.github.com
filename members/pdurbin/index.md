I started the #sourcefu IRC channel (where I go by "pdurbin") and log it at http://irclog.greptilian.com/sourcefu/today 

http://greptilian.com is my website, where you can find links to my accounts on GitHub, Twitter, etc.

I authored most of the sourcefu home page, including our guiding principles, and created the [sourcefu logo](/logo).
