I go by the nick `sivoais` in `#sourcefu` (it's an
[ambigram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambigram)). I'm interested in FOSS and
open science. Making things open is the fastest way to spread knowledge so I
try to make everything I do openly available and `#sourcefu` is a great place
to discuss that.

I write things at my website <http://enetdown.org/>. You can also find links to
my various online accounts on there.
