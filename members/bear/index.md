I am an avid lurker in #sourcefu, #crimsonfu and #indiewebcamp and a huge fan of the [IndieWeb scene](http://indiewebcamp.com)

I work on mostly Python projects:  [parsedatetime](https://github.com/bear/parsedatetime) and [python-twitter](https://github.com/bear/python-twitter)

My $dayjob is running the SRE Team at [CircleCI](https://circleci.com) where you can find me wrangling AWS, GCE, Kubernetes, Nomad, Docker, Terraform and Ansible all with the goal of keeping the build jobs running fast and smooth.

You can find my h-card at <https://bear.im>
