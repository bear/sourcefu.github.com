sourcefu is a software development community that logs its IRC channel publicly at http://irclog.greptilian.com/sourcefu/today because "[we live in a world of infinitely searchable micro-content, and every contribution, however small, enriches all of us](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2007/04/when-in-doubt-make-it-public.html)."

"fu" comes from The Jargon File and means "[expert practice of a skill][jargonfile-fu]." It is short for "Kung Fu" but rather than referring to martial arts, the "fu" in "sourcefu" refers to the original Chinese meaning of 功夫 (gōngfu): "[any study, learning, or practice that requires patience, energy, and time to complete][wikipedia-kungfu]."
